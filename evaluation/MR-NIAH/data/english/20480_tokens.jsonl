This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Code**\n\n1. **Importing the `random` Module:**\n   ```python\n   import random\n   ```\n   - The `random` module is used to generate random numbers.\n\n2. **Defining the `guess_number_game` Function:**\n   ```python\n   def guess_number_game():\n       ...\n   ```\n   - Encapsulates the game logic within a function for better organization.\n\n3. **Welcome Message:**\n   ```python\n   print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n   print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n   ```\n   - Greets the player and informs them of the range.\n\n4. **Generating the Secret Number:**\n   ```python\n   secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n   ```\n   - `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer N such that `a <= N <= b`.\n\n5. **Setting Up Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   attempts = 0\n   max_attempts = 10\n   ```\n   - `attempts` keeps track of the number of guesses.\n   - `max_attempts` limits the number of guesses the player can make.\n\n6. **The Guessing Loop:**\n   ```python\n   while attempts < max_attempts:\n       try:\n           guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n       except ValueError:\n           print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n           continue\n       ...\n   ```\n   - The loop runs until the player runs out of attempts.\n   - `try-except` block ensures that the player enters a valid integer.\n   - If the input is invalid, the player is prompted again.\n\n7. **Processing the Guess:**\n   ```python\n   attempts += 1\n\n   if guess < secret_number:\n       print(\"Too low!\")\n   elif guess > secret_number:\n       print(\"Too high!\")\n   else:\n       print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python. It covers essential programming concepts and can be expanded in various ways to make it more challenging and engaging.

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python.

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil. Therefore, as summer droughts intensify, many trees in Germany's conifer plantations, especially spruce, which are more dependent on summer rainfall than beech and oak, begin to cease photosynthesis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "However, this system does not function effectively in monocultures like spruce and pine.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil. Therefore, as summer droughts intensify, many trees in Germany's conifer plantations, especially spruce, which are more dependent on summer rainfall than beech and oak, begin to cease photosynthesis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "However, this system does not function effectively in monocultures like spruce and pine.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil. Therefore, as summer droughts intensify, many trees in Germany's conifer plantations, especially spruce, which are more dependent on summer rainfall than beech and oak, begin to cease photosynthesis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "However, this system does not function effectively in monocultures like spruce and pine.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.

However, I am more inclined to think that the local soil organisms in Germany are less efficient at decomposing needles rich in terpenes and resin. Rainwater attempts to penetrate the dense canopy of spruce and pine to reach the soil but faces another obstacle: the forest floor is covered with a thick carpet formed by years of accumulated needles. I often observe that this needle carpet seems to have waterproof properties: after a prolonged drought, water runs off the surface of the carpet rather than seeping into the soil.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

The theme of this essay is 'Growth in the Wind and Rain,' and the content is as follows: The rainwater washes over the earth, the scenery around me gradually fades away, but it cannot wash away a wild grass beside me. I seem to be like it, persisting in the wind and rain, with the dream in my heart never extinguished. I understand that I have always been growing in the wind and rain. The past glory and achievements, the past efforts and rewards, have they already been destined to be swept away? Facing reality, I cannot bear to accept this failure. I feel unwilling, yet I worry that I cannot turn the situation around, my heart shrouded in dark clouds, aching deeply. Learning is a war without smoke. Without enough knowledge to arm oneself, one might become a casualty of this war. But I firmly believe that I will not be one of them. I long to soar in the sky like an eagle, flying toward my sunshine. However, the failure in the exam makes me feel powerless to recover. With so many strong competitors, I have not even entered the high school entrance exam, yet I have already retreated, becoming a glaring name on the list of failures. Walking out of the classroom alone, what lingers in my mind are those red crosses, deeply piercing my heart. The sunshine is no longer bright, and the gray sky envelops my sorrow. Tears slide down my cheeks, turning into raindrops falling from the sky. The wind accompanies the rain, brushing past my burning cheeks, sending chills through me. The wind seems to mock, the rain seems to ridicule, and the gray world seems unwilling to bring me a ray of sunshine. However, in this wind and rain, I see a striking life. In the wind and rain, the wild chrysanthemum sways unyieldingly. No matter how the wind blows, no matter how the rain presses, it firmly holds onto its mission and ideals. It believes that one day, its mission will be fulfilled, and its dreams will come true. It never strives to be the king of flowers, nor does it aspire to fly like a dandelion. It has only one humble dream: never retreat, forge ahead, be a strong person in life, grow in the wind and rain, and constantly pursue self-growth. If such a small life force can be so tenacious, what reason do I have not to learn from it? Fourteen years of spring and autumn, I have spent in the wind and rain, so what does failure count for? The journey of life is still long. Starting from the beginning, I have persisted for so many years and must not give up halfway. Since I chose this path, I must stick to it to the end to achieve my extraordinary ideals. The journey of life is destined to be unavoidable from wind and rain, and inescapable from the shackles of failure. So why not try to face it with a positive attitude? Believe that destiny is in your own hands. One day, the shackles will be broken, and the sunshine will illuminate the road ahead. 'The sunshine always comes after the rain, please believe there is a rainbow.' This song lingers in my ears, giving me hope and letting me see the sunshine. I believe that after the wind and rain, there will definitely be a rainbow. I know that I have always been growing in the wind and rain.
