This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Code**\n\n1. **Importing the `random` Module:**\n   ```python\n   import random\n   ```\n   - The `random` module is used to generate random numbers.\n\n2. **Defining the `guess_number_game` Function:**\n   ```python\n   def guess_number_game():\n       ...\n   ```\n   - Encapsulates the game logic within a function for better organization.\n\n3. **Welcome Message:**\n   ```python\n   print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n   print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n   ```\n   - Greets the player and informs them of the range.\n\n4. **Generating the Secret Number:**\n   ```python\n   secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n   ```\n   - `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer N such that `a <= N <= b`.\n\n5. **Setting Up Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   attempts = 0\n   max_attempts = 10\n   ```\n   - `attempts` keeps track of the number of guesses.\n   - `max_attempts` limits the number of guesses the player can make.\n\n6. **The Guessing Loop:**\n   ```python\n   while attempts < max_attempts:\n       try:\n           guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n       except ValueError:\n           print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n           continue\n       ...\n   ```\n   - The loop runs until the player runs out of attempts.\n   - `try-except` block ensures that the player enters a valid integer.\n   - If the input is invalid, the player is prompted again.\n\n7. **Processing the Guess:**\n   ```python\n   attempts += 1\n\n   if guess < secret_number:\n       print(\"Too low!\")\n   elif guess > secret_number:\n       print(\"Too high!\")\n   else:\n       print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python. It covers essential programming concepts and can be expanded in various ways to make it more challenging and engaging.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level.

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Code**\n\n1. **Importing the `random` Module:**\n   ```python\n   import random\n   ```\n   - The `random` module is used to generate random numbers.\n\n2. **Defining the `guess_number_game` Function:**\n   ```python\n   def guess_number_game():\n       ...\n   ```\n   - Encapsulates the game logic within a function for better organization.\n\n3. **Welcome Message:**\n   ```python\n   print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n   print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n   ```\n   - Greets the player and informs them of the range.\n\n4. **Generating the Secret Number:**\n   ```python\n   secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n   ```\n   - `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer N such that `a <= N <= b`.\n\n5. **Setting Up Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   attempts = 0\n   max_attempts = 10\n   ```\n   - `attempts` keeps track of the number of guesses.\n   - `max_attempts` limits the number of guesses the player can make.\n\n6. **The Guessing Loop:**\n   ```python\n   while attempts < max_attempts:\n       try:\n           guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n       except ValueError:\n           print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n           continue\n       ...\n   ```\n   - The loop runs until the player runs out of attempts.\n   - `try-except` block ensures that the player enters a valid integer.\n   - If the input is invalid, the player is prompted again.\n\n7. **Processing the Guess:**\n   ```python\n   attempts += 1\n\n   if guess < secret_number:\n       print(\"Too low!\")\n   elif guess > secret_number:\n       print(\"Too high!\")\n   else:\n       print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python. It covers essential programming concepts and can be expanded in various ways to make it more challenging and engaging.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Code**\n\n1. **Importing the `random` Module:**\n   ```python\n   import random\n   ```\n   - The `random` module is used to generate random numbers.\n\n2. **Defining the `guess_number_game` Function:**\n   ```python\n   def guess_number_game():\n       ...\n   ```\n   - Encapsulates the game logic within a function for better organization.\n\n3. **Welcome Message:**\n   ```python\n   print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n   print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n   ```\n   - Greets the player and informs them of the range.\n\n4. **Generating the Secret Number:**\n   ```python\n   secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n   ```\n   - `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer N such that `a <= N <= b`.\n\n5. **Setting Up Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   attempts = 0\n   max_attempts = 10\n   ```\n   - `attempts` keeps track of the number of guesses.\n   - `max_attempts` limits the number of guesses the player can make.\n\n6. **The Guessing Loop:**\n   ```python\n   while attempts < max_attempts:\n       try:\n           guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n       except ValueError:\n           print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n           continue\n       ...\n   ```\n   - The loop runs until the player runs out of attempts.\n   - `try-except` block ensures that the player enters a valid integer.\n   - If the input is invalid, the player is prompted again.\n\n7. **Processing the Guess:**\n   ```python\n   attempts += 1\n\n   if guess < secret_number:\n       print(\"Too low!\")\n   elif guess > secret_number:\n       print(\"Too high!\")\n   else:\n       print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations!

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python. It covers essential programming concepts and can be expanded in various ways to make it more challenging and engaging.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Code**\n\n1. **Importing the `random` Module:**\n   ```python\n   import random\n   ```\n   - The `random` module is used to generate random numbers.\n\n2. **Defining the `guess_number_game` Function:**\n   ```python\n   def guess_number_game():\n       ...\n   ```\n   - Encapsulates the game logic within a function for better organization.\n\n3. **Welcome Message:**\n   ```python\n   print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n   print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n   ```\n   - Greets the player and informs them of the range.\n\n4. **Generating the Secret Number:**\n   ```python\n   secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n   ```\n   - `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer N such that `a <= N <= b`.\n\n5. **Setting Up Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   attempts = 0\n   max_attempts = 10\n   ```\n   - `attempts` keeps track of the number of guesses.\n   - `max_attempts` limits the number of guesses the player can make.\n\n6. **The Guessing Loop:**\n   ```python\n   while attempts < max_attempts:\n       try:\n           guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n       except ValueError:\n           print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n           continue\n       ...\n   ```\n   - The loop runs until the player runs out of attempts.\n   - `try-except` block ensures that the player enters a valid integer.\n   - If the input is invalid, the player is prompted again.\n\n7. **Processing the Guess:**\n   ```python\n   attempts += 1\n\n   if guess < secret_number:\n       print(\"Too low!\")\n   elif guess > secret_number:\n       print(\"Too high!\")\n   else:\n       print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations!

You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python. It covers essential programming concepts and can be expanded in various ways to make it more challenging and engaging.

This classic game is perfect for beginners and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and user input.\n\n## **Game Overview**\n\n- **Objective:** The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it.\n- **Features:**\n  - The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.\n  - The player is prompted to guess the number.\n  - After each guess, the game provides feedback:\n    - \"Too high!\" if the guess is higher than the secret number.\n    - \"Too low!\" if the guess is lower than the secret number.\n    - \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Code**\n\n1. **Importing the `random` Module:**\n   ```python\n   import random\n   ```\n   - The `random` module is used to generate random numbers.\n\n2. **Defining the `guess_number_game` Function:**\n   ```python\n   def guess_number_game():\n       ...\n   ```\n   - Encapsulates the game logic within a function for better organization.\n\n3. **Welcome Message:**\n   ```python\n   print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n   print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n   ```\n   - Greets the player and informs them of the range.\n\n4. **Generating the Secret Number:**\n   ```python\n   secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n   ```\n   - `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer N such that `a <= N <= b`.\n\n5. **Setting Up Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   attempts = 0\n   max_attempts = 10\n   ```\n   - `attempts` keeps track of the number of guesses.\n   - `max_attempts` limits the number of guesses the player can make.\n\n6. **The Guessing Loop:**\n   ```python\n   while attempts < max_attempts:\n       try:\n           guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n       except ValueError:\n           print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n           continue\n       ...\n   ```\n   - The loop runs until the player runs out of attempts.\n   - `try-except` block ensures that the player enters a valid integer.\n   - If the input is invalid, the player is prompted again.\n\n7. **Processing the Guess:**\n   ```python\n   attempts += 1\n\n   if guess < secret_number:\n       print(\"Too low!\")\n   elif guess > secret_number:\n       print(\"Too high!\")\n   else:\n       print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python.

You guessed it!\" if the guess is correct.\n  - The game keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it at the end.\n\n## **Python Code**\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the \"Guess the Number\" game:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # You can adjust the number of attempts\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if input is invalid\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n### **Explanation of the Code**\n\n1. **Importing the `random` Module:**\n   ```python\n   import random\n   ```\n   - The `random` module is used to generate random numbers.\n\n2. **Defining the `guess_number_game` Function:**\n   ```python\n   def guess_number_game():\n       ...\n   ```\n   - Encapsulates the game logic within a function for better organization.\n\n3. **Welcome Message:**\n   ```python\n   print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n   print(\"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\")\n   ```\n   - Greets the player and informs them of the range.\n\n4. **Generating the Secret Number:**\n   ```python\n   secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n   ```\n   - `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer N such that `a <= N <= b`.\n\n5. **Setting Up Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   attempts = 0\n   max_attempts = 10\n   ```\n   - `attempts` keeps track of the number of guesses.\n   - `max_attempts` limits the number of guesses the player can make.\n\n6. **The Guessing Loop:**\n   ```python\n   while attempts < max_attempts:\n       try:\n           guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n       except ValueError:\n           print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n           continue\n       ...\n   ```\n   - The loop runs until the player runs out of attempts.\n   - `try-except` block ensures that the player enters a valid integer.\n   - If the input is invalid, the player is prompted again.\n\n7. **Processing the Guess:**\n   ```python\n   attempts += 1\n\n   if guess < secret_number:\n       print(\"Too low!\")\n   elif guess > secret_number:\n       print(\"Too high!\")\n   else:\n       print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n       break\n   ```\n   - Increments the attempt count.\n   - Provides feedback based on the guess.\n   - If the guess is correct, congratulates the player and breaks out of the loop.\n\n8. **Handling Exceeded Attempts:**\n   ```python\n   else:\n       print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n       print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n   ```\n   - If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed attempts, reveals the secret number.\n\n9. **Running the Game:**\n   ```python\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       guess_number_game()\n   ```\n   - Ensures that the game runs when the script is executed directly.\n\n## **How to Run the Game**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   - **Option 1: Using a Python Script File**\n     - Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n     - Copy and paste the above code into the editor.\n     - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `guess_number_game.py`.\n     - Open a terminal or command prompt.\n     - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n     - Run the game by typing:\n       ```\n       python guess_number_game.py\n       ```\n   \n   - **Option 2: Using an Online Python Interpreter**\n     - Visit an online Python compiler like [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n     - Create a new Python project or notebook.\n     - Paste the code into the editor.\n     - Run the code to start playing.\n\n## **Sample Gameplay**\n\n```\nWelcome to the Guess the Number Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nAttempt 1/10: Enter your guess: 50\nToo low!\nAttempt 2/10: Enter your guess: 75\nToo high!\nAttempt 3/10: Enter your guess: 63\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.\n```\n\n## **Enhancements and Variations**\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the basic game, you can enhance it or create variations:\n\n1. **Difficulty Levels:**\n   - **Easy:** Number between 1-50, 15 attempts.\n   - **Medium:** Number between 1-100, 10 attempts.\n   - **Hard:** Number between 1-1000, 15 attempts.\n\n2. **Multiple Games:**\n   - Allow the player to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.\n\n3. **High Scores:**\n   - Keep track of the lowest number of attempts to guess the number.\n\n4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**\n   - Use libraries like `tkinter` to create a GUI version of the game.\n\n### **Example: Adding Difficulty Levels**\n\nHere's how you can modify the game to include difficulty levels:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef guess_number_game():\n    print(\"Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!\")\n    print(\"Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, hard\")\n    difficulty = input(\"Enter difficulty: \").lower()\n\n    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 50\n        max_attempts = 15\n    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 1000\n        max_attempts = 15\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid difficulty level. Defaulting to medium.\")\n        lower_bound = 1\n        upper_bound = 100\n        max_attempts = 10\n\n    print(f\"I'm thinking of a number between {lower_bound} and {upper_bound}.\")\n\n    secret_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    attempts = 0\n\n    while attempts < max_attempts:\n        try:\n            guess = int(input(f\"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: Enter your guess: \"))\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n            continue\n\n        attempts += 1\n\n        if guess < secret_number:\n            print(\"Too low!\")\n        elif guess > secret_number:\n            print(\"Too high!\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, you've used all {max_attempts} attempts.\")\n        print(f\"The number I was thinking of was {secret_number}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    guess_number_game()\n```\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe \"Guess the Number\" game is a great starting point for learning Python.
